The user can toggle modules ON and OFF using the first drop-down menu on the top right.\nCustom installations allow to specify whether a dataset should be pre-loaded and allow setting the initial state of most application settings, including modules and themes.\n The documentation on this site ir organized by module: each chapter, accessible from the navigation in the lest, corresponds to an individual module.\n rtemislive is built on top of rtemis\nData operations, including filtering, selecting and a subset of data aggregation operations, performed in real time using data.table."

Clean data includes:\n\nDescriptive column names that always begin with letters (not numbers!) and contain no symbols other than underscores\nDescriptive categorical levels: e.g. “Female”, “Male”, not “1”, “2”; “Control”, “Case”, not “0”, “1”)\n\nIf you have prepared a dataset in R, the most convenient way to upload to rtemislive is to use saveRD() to save to an RDS and then upload that file. This will maintain all column classes."

Hover over any preprocess option on the right menu to display a tooltip with the corresponding description.\nThe following operations are available:\n\nData Cleaning\n\nRemove constants\nRemove duplicates\n\nBatch Type Conversions, i.e. convert all columns of a type to another type\n\nCharacter to factor\nLogical to factor\nInteger to numeric\n\nConvert all variables with up to a particular number of unique values to factor\nIndividual variable conversion\n\nSelect a variable by name and convert to any type\n\nHandle missing data:\n\nFactor NA to missing: Considering all factor variables, convert missing values to a new level named “missing”. This is one way to impute categorical data\nImpute missing data: Uses iterative random forest with predictive mean matching to predict missing data from available data\n\nAdd missingness: Add an indicator column for each variable that is being imputed indicating cases whose data was imputed\n\nComplete cases: keep complete cases only\n\nData Transformations\n\nScale numeric data: Transformed all numeric columns to have a standard deviation of 1\nCenter numeric data: Transformed all numeric columns to have a mean of 0\nOne-hot encode categorical: One-hot all categorical variables\n\nReorder factor levels: Allows you to pick any factor in the dataset and explicitly set the order of levels. This affects the order categorical levels appear in plots, and which level is considered as the baseline in linear models.\nDelete columns: Allows removing columns from your data"
